causal knowledge graph for business and management

Causal Knowledge Graph (Causal KG) for Business and Management



We are constructing the world's largest causal knowledgebase concerning business and management. Built on knowledge graph technologies and graphic data science, we seek to visually represent and query a network of deductive knowledge (e.g., high-quality scientific literature) and inductive knowledge (e.g., cognitive models from seasoned practitioners).



*We are currently examining the policies regarding 'fair use' and 'knowledge IP' before we make our CausalKG publicly accessible.
